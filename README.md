IV Semester DBS Project

Me, along with a group of other three members-- created a Blood Donation System which has several features such as Donating/Receiving Blood, Tracking Blood inventory, Viewing Donor history and a Feedback Form.

PL/SQL, Node.js has been utilised for the backend of the project and HTML/CSS for the front-end interface.
